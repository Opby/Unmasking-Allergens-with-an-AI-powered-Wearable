# Introduction
* Develop an AI-powered wearable device to detect humanâ€™s allergic reactions by recording and analyzing cough and sneeze types and patterns. A pre-trained AI model is used to identify unique characteristics of cough and sneeze associated with allergies. By correlating this data with location-based allergen information, the project aims to provide a novel and accessible way for everyone to detect their allergens without having to visit medical clinics.
